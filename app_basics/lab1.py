"""
Create a cli tool that will keep running, waiting for user input, evaluating and printing.

As a user, I want to be able to input a file path(hint, see os.path), apply head/tail on the file content,
    and see the output  (for example first 3 lines)
As a user, I want to be able to input a csv line, apply head/tail on the line content,
    and see the output(for example first 3 columns)
As a user, I want to be able to exit with a special command (for example '//exit')

As a user, I want to be able to input anything else and see only the head/tail
As a user, I want the program to output the accumulated first word of every line

The tool should print(meaningfully) the exact date and time in which it started, and in which it ended.

save current user input, while input is not exact match '//exit', keep running... (while loop with condition)

testing conditions for each line:
 test if 'exit' cmd, if true -> somehow to exit the while loop -

=====
Expected user input in the following line format:
first word - commands:
                    breakout valid values: '//quit', '//exit'
                    head - will be followed by a number (optional default  1)
                    tail - will be followed by a number (optional default  1)
                    print - display the content of the rest of the line to the console.
Second word -   file path, only if file exist will do the head/tail command on the file.
                If not a file, see if contains commas ',' for CSV line.

Third number - optional how many lines, default 3
